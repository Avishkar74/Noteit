🚀 How To Publish Your Extension On Chrome Web Store
🧾 STEP 1 — Prepare Production Build

Before publishing, ensure:

✅ manifest.json uses Manifest V3
✅ No console errors
✅ All permissions are intentional
✅ Icons are added (required)
✅ Version is updated (e.g., "version": "0.1.0")

Required Icons

In your manifest:

"icons": {
  "16": "icons/icon16.png",
  "48": "icons/icon48.png",
  "128": "icons/icon128.png"
}


You MUST provide:

16x16

48x48

128x128

PNG format only.

📦 STEP 2 — Create Production ZIP

Chrome Web Store requires a ZIP file.

Your ZIP should contain:

manifest.json
background.js
content.js
panel.html
panel.js
icons/
styles/


Important:

Do NOT zip the parent folder.

Zip the extension files directly.

Do NOT include node_modules.

Do NOT include .git.

Do NOT include backend folder.

🌐 STEP 3 — Create Chrome Developer Account

Go to:

👉 https://chrome.google.com/webstore/devconsole

You must:

Sign in with Google account

Pay one-time $5 developer fee

This is required only once.

📝 STEP 4 — Create New Item

In Developer Dashboard:

Click:
➕ “Add New Item”

Upload your ZIP file.

Chrome will:

Validate manifest

Check permissions

Run automated review

🧾 STEP 5 — Fill Store Listing Details

You must provide:

Basic Info

Extension Name

Short description

Full description

Write clearly what it does.

Category

Choose:

Productivity

Screenshots (Important)

Upload:

1280x800 or 640x400 images

Show:

Panel open

Region selection

Preview list

Download action

Screenshots increase approval speed.

Icons & Branding

128x128 icon (store)

Optional promotional image

🔐 STEP 6 — Privacy & Permissions Section

This is VERY important.

Chrome will ask:

What data does your extension collect?

For your project, answer:

✔️ Does NOT collect personal data
✔️ Does NOT track user activity
✔️ Screenshots stored locally only
✔️ Upload from phone is temporary

Be honest.

⚠️ STEP 7 — Permissions Justification

You must explain why you use:

activeTab

tabs

storage

downloads

scripting

Write clear justification like:

"Used to capture visible tab and generate downloadable PDF."

If unclear, they may reject.

🔍 STEP 8 — Submit For Review

Click:
“Submit for Review”

Review time:

1–3 days usually

Sometimes a week

If rejected:
They’ll tell you why.

🧠 After Approval

You get:

Public Chrome Web Store link

Users can install it

Auto-updates work

When you push new version:

Increase version in manifest

Zip again

Upload new version

Submit update

Chrome handles updates automatically.

🛑 Common Rejection Reasons

Avoid these:

❌ Too many unnecessary permissions
❌ Not explaining screenshot usage
❌ No privacy policy (if backend exists)
❌ Broken functionality
❌ Hardcoded localhost backend URL

If you add backend (QR upload):

You MUST:

Add privacy policy URL

Host simple privacy page

🌍 When Backend Exists (Phase 3+)

You must:

Deploy backend publicly (HTTPS)

Use secure domain

Add privacy policy link

Declare remote code usage if applicable

Chrome is strict about remote execution.

🔁 Publishing Updates

Workflow:

Bump version in manifest:

"version": "0.2.0"


Zip new build

Upload in Dev Console

Submit for review

Users auto-update

📊 Pro Tip (Professional Touch)

Test in Incognito

Test on 3–4 websites

Test memory limits

Test restart recovery
